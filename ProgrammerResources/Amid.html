            <h3>Python</h3>
            <div>
                <p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">Codecademy:</a></p>
                <p class="resource-indent">
                    Codecademy is a great resource for learning to code most any language.<br>
                    Their Python 3 course is an amazing one for beginners, as it showcases how easy python is to learn, <br>
                    as well as the methods used throughout most of their courses. 
                </p>

                <p class="resource-indent">
                    W3Schools is another amazing resource for programmers.<br>
                    Although they mostly focus on Web Development, they also have pages and tutorials on python. <br>
                    These are more about reading and examples than having you type yourself, but they are <br>
                    still a great way to find what you are looking for.

                <p class="resource-indent">
                    TutorialsPoint is a good all around resource, but they mostly focus on the textbook <br>
                    of the language. This leads to it being a bit more boring to read, but still great <br>
                    if you have the time and dedication to read it all.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            This is not meant to be the end all of python. These are just the tip of the iceberg with what you can do, <br>
            and I encourage you to look elsewhere to find information. Google is your best friend.
